XeLL-Reloaded catches CPU threads, sets them up, loads an ELF file from either network (tftp), USB(fat), CDROM (ISO9660) or HDD(fat), and launches it. It's made to boot Linux, so it contains a flat device tree for Linux. However, it is able to load other ELF files as well, like applications based on LibXenon.

* Now based on LibXenon
* Supports the new Reset Glitch Hack - RGH. (xell-gggggg)
* XeLL-Reloaded is now divided in 2 stages:
	- 1st Stage initializes the Hardware, uncompresses and executes 2nd Stage
	- 2nd Stage (based on LibXenon) loads all required drivers and does the usual "XeLL tasks"
* XeLL can unzip & load gzipped files
* Support for HDMI, and properly switches NTSC/PAL on composite.
* All CPU Cores are active and ready to run at full speed.
* TinyEHCI is used, delivers full USB 2.0 speed when accessing mass storage media
* lwip network stack upgraded to v1.4 Final - It's faster and DHCP is improved.
* It can access the DVD-drive via DMA now: faster reading
* It's possible to reload into XeLL now when you are inside a LibXenon Application
* New HTTP web interface to retrieve nand dump.
* Improved hardware initialization now allows chain-loading.
* Supports upgrading with a 2-stage XeLL-Reloaded binary, named "updxell.bin"
* Infinite boot loop when looking for ELFs to execute.(no more rushing to get the live-cd in)
* Parses / decrypts keyvault
* Supports kboot.conf-type file (from marcan for AsbestOS), XeLL Menu branch (from Ge0rg's XeLL-Menu branch)
* Supports external initramfs
* Can pass a custom CMDLINE to linux kernel via kboot.conf

  HOW TO USE
==============

XeLL Reloaded checks for *.elf(homebrew/linux elf32)/kboot.conf/initrd/updxell.bin or updflash.bin in the following order:

USB (FAT):	updflash.bin
		updxell.bin
		kboot.conf
		initrd.gz
		xenon.elf
		xenon.z
		vmlinux
Network: 	DHCP supplied bootserver and bootfile-name. You can supply a static tftpserver ip via kboot.conf. If no tftpserver is found, it falls back to a static ip.
		( no updxell support via tftp)
DVD (ISO9660):	*same as USB*	
HDD (FAT):	*same as USB*


updflash.bin is a already remapped flashimage/nandimage. 16MB file for 16MB NAND and 64MB file for 64/256/512MB NAND.

updxell.bin is a renamed xell*.bin file. * Version depending on the used hack (JTAG XeLL: xell-1f, RGH XeLL: xell-gggggg)

kboot.conf (modified for XeLL) is a configfile (sample config included in release packages - git: source/lv2/kboot/kboot.conf.sample)
	General XeLL config: Set TFTP-Server, CPU-Speedup, videomode, NetConfig
	Menu: Parses bootentries, shows a user controlable menu with XboxController/UART/IR Remote
	      It can parse bootarguments for linux kernels & can load initramfs/initrd 

initrd.gz can be either gzipped or bare cpio binary. If you want to load linux you can load initrd.gz before and it gets passed to linux devtree.

xenon.elf/xenon.z/vmlinux can be either gzipped or bare ELF32 binaries - LINUX or Homebrew



There's also a HTTP Server running while XeLL searches for executable binaries.
It can serve the CPUKey/DVDKey and the console's flashdump.
